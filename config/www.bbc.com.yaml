# Example site-specific configuration
# ====================================
# Create files named by domain (e.g., www.example.com.yaml) to customize
# rules for specific sites. Argus auto-detects these by matching the URL domain.
#
# Rule prefixes:
#   ALLOW:    Accept this pattern as intentional design (don't flag as defect)
#   IGNORE:   Skip checking this element entirely
#   CRITICAL: This element MUST be visible/functional (always flag if broken)

url: "https://www.bbc.com"
rules:
  - "ALLOW: Text overlaying video thumbnails (this is a stylistic choice)"
  - "ALLOW: Carousel arrows hanging half-off the screen edge"
  - "ALLOW: Headline text over hero images"
  - "IGNORE: Live ticker or breaking news banners at the bottom"
  - "IGNORE: Cookie consent banner (unless it blocks entire viewport)"

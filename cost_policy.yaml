# Cost Policy for Argus
# =====================
# This is a CircuitBreaker-style policy file that controls API spending.
#
# The cost tracker will:
# - Block calls that would exceed daily_limit_usd
# - Block calls that would exceed single_call_limit_usd
# - Refuse to use any model in blocked_models

# Maximum spend per day (USD)
# After this limit is reached, all API calls will be blocked until midnight UTC
daily_limit_usd: 0.50  # $0.50/day - enough for ~100 analyses

# Maximum spend per single API call (USD)
# Prevents accidentally using an expensive model
single_call_limit_usd: 1.00

# Models that are never allowed
# Use this to prevent expensive models from being used accidentally
blocked_models:
  - "gpt-4-turbo" # Very expensive, not needed for this use case
  # - "gpt-4o"     # Uncomment to block high-res verification

# Where to store spend history
spend_file: "spend_history.json"
